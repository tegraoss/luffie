# Luffie (PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT)
A state management library for React.

If you need a simple way to manage your application's state without needing to rewrite a lot of code, maybe you like Luffie.

You can keep your state centralized at our **Store** and create functions that alter the Store State. Everytime the state is updated, all components plugged into it are renderized automatically.
